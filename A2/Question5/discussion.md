## Q5

1. The code violates the "Dependency Inversion Principle"

2. The "Dependency Inversion Principle" states that high-level modules should not depend low-level modules,
   both of them should depend on abstractions. The high-level module - CountryGDPReport depends on two
   low-level modules - Canada and Mexico.

3. See code.
