1. The code violates "Single Responsibility Principle"

2. The "Single Responsibility Principle" states that a class should only have a single responsibility,
   i.e. changes to only one part of the software's specification should be able to affect the specification
   of the class. In the given code, the ProfitReport class is not only responsible for creating the profit
   report, but is also responsible for sending the report to printer and email, which violates the "Single
   Responsibility Principle".
